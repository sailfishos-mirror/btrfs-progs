# Run python tests on various version
#
# NOTE: The minimum compatible version is 3.6 but the CI base image does not provide it.
# NOTE: The recent python versions (3.12 and up) fail to set up due to old python3-setuptools in the image
# NOTE: The workflow could still pass even if the individual tests fail (FIXME)
